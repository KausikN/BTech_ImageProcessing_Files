1. Download Lena image and scale it by factors of 1,2,0.5 using bilinear interpolation and display the scaled images. 
Also, display the output of built-in functions for doing scaling by factors of 0.5,2. 
Compare the results.

2. Download the leaning tower of PISA image and find the angle of inclination using appropriate rotations with bilinear interpolation.

3. Do histogram equalization on pout-dark and display the same

4. Do histogram matching(specification) on the pout-dark image, keeping pout-bright as a reference image.
(Please find the attached pout-dark,pout-bright images)
