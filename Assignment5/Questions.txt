1. Write a function to implement FFT for 1D signal.
2. Implement DFT function for an image using the FFT for 1D signal using q1.
3. Consider the images of lena and dog images attached. Find phase and magnitude of the dog and lena images using DFT function implemented in q2.
4. Swap phase of the dog image and magnitude of the lena image and display the output.
5. Swap phase of the lena image and magnitude of the dog image ad display the output.
