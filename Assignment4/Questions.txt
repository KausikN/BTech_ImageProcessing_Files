1. Download Lena color image convert it to grayscale image and 
add salt and  pepper noise with noise quantity 0.1,0.2 upto 1 and generate 10 noisy images.

    a. Do average filtering ( by correlating with average filter ) of varying sizes for each image. 
    Filter size can be 3*3, 5*5, 7*7. (In 3*3 filter all the values are 1/9, 
    in 5*5 filter all the values are 1/25 and in 7*7 filter all the values are 1/49)

    b. Similarly, repeat the question 1.a by replacing the average filter by median filter.

2. 
    a. Consider the image the attached named as hdraw.png and crop each of the characters from the image and consider that as the sub-image. 
    Find the location of the sub-image in the original by using correlation.
    
    b. Download Lena color image convert it to grayscale image and crop the left eye of Lena as sub-image and 
    do the cross-correlation (Normalized correlation) to find the location of the left eye in the original image.
